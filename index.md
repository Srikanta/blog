### Skills

I am a design concious developer focused on PHP, JavaScript, and various typed languages. I am comfortable working on hardware projects based in C or C#, but also work on web technologies based on Java servers.

Currently, I am focusing primarily on Node.js projects.

### Goals

I would like to expand my side-projects in Node.js. I am working with [Senior meets junior](https://smj.dev), a online community of developers who collaborate on side projects to learn new languages.
